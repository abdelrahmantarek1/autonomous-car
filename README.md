# autonomous-car
This project aims to implement a self-driving Car that can avoid the
obstacles with very fast response:
 1. Ultrasonic is placed on servo motor axis, its function to detect
    the obstacles on the car way.
 2. If the car found an obstacle, it must change its way according
    to the ultrasonic data.
